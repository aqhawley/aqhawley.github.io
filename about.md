I am a social scientist getting my formal start in the world of data science. I am a current student in the Master of Science in Social Data Analytics & Research (SDAR) program at the University of Texas at Dallas and an associate faculty member teaching sociology at Collin College in Frisco, TX. My background and training until recently have been in applied social science and qualitative research methods. My experience consists of academic research and teaching, policy analysis in state and local government, and market research for small businesses and startups.

This site is a work-in-progress and will serve as a portfolio of my graduate program lab assignments, current projects and other data science activities.

### Interests

My research interests are in neighborhood change, cultural and housing displacement, housing affordability, the suburbanization of poverty and other urban policy issues. Data mining, geospatial analysis, machine learning, web scraping, and data visualization are skills I am developing in my graduate coursework.

My current research projects focus on the application of social media data analysis, geographic information science, and machine learning to predict and track gentrification in urban neighborhoods. It is my hope that these tools can be leveraged to better inform urban planners and policymakers about neighborhood change, and mitigate the harms of displacement.

### Skills

Developing skills in: R, Python, Java, GIS, Tableau, SQL

### Education

MS in Social Data Analytics & Research - University of Texas at Dallas <br>
MS in Sociology - Texas A&M University - Kingsville <br>
BA in Political Science - Texas A&M University - Kingsville 

### More Information

Outside of my academic research interests, I am also exploring big data analysis and machine learning applications for the industrial hemp industry. I am a hemp farmer and executive of Hawley Hemp Labs, a family-owned and operated industrial hemp producer, processor, and analytical lab based in East Texas. I also lend my research and analysis skills to small businesses and startups seeking market research to scale up and expand their customer bases through data-driven marketing strategies. 

As a social scientist, I am driven by the belief that data science is a critical tool to promote social equity and help solve pressing social problems. I am an advocate for equitable and ethical data use, and the the use of data science to improve the lives of communities of color and marginalized groups.
