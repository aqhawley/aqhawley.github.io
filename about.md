I am a sociology professor at Collin College in Frisco, TX and a data-scientist in-training. I am also currently a graduate student in the Master of Science in Social Data Analytics & Research (SDAR) program at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research background is primarily in qualitative research and I am fairly new to data science and data analytics for social science research. This site serves as a portfolio of my graduate program projects and research interests.
