I am a social scientist getting my formal start in the world of data science. I am a current student in the Master of Science in Social Data Analytics & Research (SDAR) program at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am also an associate faculty member of sociology at Collin College in Frisco, TX and a research consultant for small businesses. My background and training until recently have been in applied social science and qualitative research methods. I have experience as an analyst in state and local government, as well as in the private sector conducting market research for small businesses and startups. 

This site is a work-in-progress and will serve as a portfolio of my graduate program lab assignments, current projects and other data science activities.

### Interests

I have general research interests relating to neighborhood change, cultural and housing displacement, housing affordability, and other urban policy and housing issues. Data mining, geospatial analysis, machine learning, web scraping, and data visualization are skills I am currently developing in my graduate coursework.

My current research projects focus on the application of social media data analysis, geographic information science, and machine learning to predict and track gentrification in urban neighborhoods. It is my hope that these tools can be leveraged to better inform urban planners and policymakers about neighborhood change, and mitigate the harms of displacement.

### More Information

Outside of my academic and research interests, I also have personal interests in the the application of big data analysis and machine learning in the industrial hemp industry. I am a hemp farmer and COO of Hawley Hemp Labs, a family-owned and operated industrial hemp producer, processor, and analytical lab based in East Texas. I also lend my research and analysis skills to small businesses and startups seeking market research. As a social scientist, I am also passionate about the power of data science as a tool to promote social equity and help solve pressing social problems.
